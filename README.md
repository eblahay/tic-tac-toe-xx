# Tic-Tac-Toe++

A CLI game of tic-tac-toe in which the user inputs
coordinates and their mark ('X', 'O', etc.) appears on the board in the corresponding
location. There is a singleplayer mode in which a human player
can face off against a simple CPU opponent, in addition to the default local two-player mode.
